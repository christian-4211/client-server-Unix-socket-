All men by nature desire to know.
An indication of this is the delight we take in our senses;
for even apart from their usefulness they are loved for themselves;
and above all others the sense of sight.
For not only with a view to action, but even when we are not going to do anything, we prefer seeing (one might say) to everything else.
The reason is that this, most of all the senses, makes us know and brings to light many differences between things.
Animals are by nature born with the faculty of sensation, and from sensation memory is produced in some of them, though not in others.
And because of memory they can be taught. The rest live by images and memories and have but little of connected experience;
but the human race lives also by art and reasonings.
From memory experience is produced in men;
for the several memories of the same thing produce finally the capacity for a single experience.
Experience seems to be very similar to science and art, but really science and art come to men through experience;
for 'experience made art,' as Polus says, 'but inexperience luck.' -Aristotle
