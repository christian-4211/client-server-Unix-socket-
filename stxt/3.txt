Everything is only for a day, both that which remembers and that which is remembered.
Observe constantly that all things take place by change.
The universe loves nothing so much as to change the things which are and to make new things like them.
For everything that exists is in a manner the seed of that which will be.
You exist as a part of the whole.
If you do well in your role, even if it is small, you serve the whole.
Cease your struggling.
Cease your complaint.
You are a thread in the great tapestry, woven by the Fates.
Does the foot demand to be the eye?
The eye to be the hand?
Be content to play your role, nobly, firmly, in accordance with nature.
And if your time has come, let go as you would a ripe fruit from a tree. - Marcus Aurelius
