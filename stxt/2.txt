Imagine human beings living in an underground, cave-like dwelling…
Here they have been from childhood, with legs and necks in chains, so they stay where they are.
They can see only what is in front of them, being prevented by the chains from turning their heads.
Light comes from a fire burning behind them.

Between the fire and the prisoners, there is a wall, like the screen in front of puppeteers, over which they show the puppets.
They see only shadows, and believe those shadows are the real world.
Now suppose one of them is freed, and turns toward the fire.

He is dazzled.
He stumbles.
He resists.
But gradually, he ascends out of the cave.
And when he sees the sun, he at last sees the truth.
Returning to the cave, he is no longer welcome.
The others laugh at him.
They threaten him.
They say the outside has blinded him.
This, Socrates, is the soul’s journey toward knowledge.
The cave is the world of appearances.
The sunlight is the form of the Good. -Plato
