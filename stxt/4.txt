Two things fill the mind with ever-increasing admiration and awe, the more often and more steadily we reflect upon them:
the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.
Neither of them do I have to seek and merely conjecture as though they were shrouded in obscurity, or hidden in transcendental regions beyond my horizon:
I see them before me and connect them immediately with the consciousness of my existence.
The first begins from the place I occupy in the external world of sense, and enlarges my connection to an unbounded field of worlds above worlds, systems beyond systems, moving in eternal order, guided by invisible laws.
The second begins within myself.
It reveals to me a law that speaks directly to me, not derived from experience, but commanding a respect that overwhelms.
Through it I am aware of a freedom that elevates me above the world of appearances, making me a citizen of a realm of ends. - Kant
